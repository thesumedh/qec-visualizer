# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing QuantumDecoder project to create a comprehensive, educational quantum error correction (QEC) visualizer. The tool will transform abstract QEC concepts into interactive, visual experiences that help users understand error injection, syndrome measurement, and correction processes. The enhanced visualizer will support multiple QEC codes, provide step-by-step guidance, and leverage Classiq for robust circuit generation while maintaining educational clarity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantum computing student, I want to interact with multiple QEC codes through a visual interface, so that I can understand how different codes protect quantum information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a selection of QEC codes including 3-qubit repetition, 5-qubit, Steane 7-qubit, and distance-3 surface code
2. WHEN the user selects a QEC code THEN the system SHALL initialize and display the encoded logical qubit state with clear visual distinction between logical and ancilla qubits
3. WHEN the user switches between codes THEN the system SHALL preserve the current step in the workflow and adapt the interface accordingly
4. IF a code requires lattice visualization THEN the system SHALL display a 2D grid representation with proper qubit and stabilizer positioning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educator, I want students to see real-time error injection and correction, so that they can grasp how QEC maintains quantum information integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on any physical qubit THEN the system SHALL provide options to inject X, Y, or Z errors
2. WHEN an error is injected THEN the system SHALL visually highlight the affected qubit and update the quantum state display
3. WHEN syndrome measurement is triggered THEN the system SHALL show which stabilizers fire without destroying the logical information
4. WHEN error correction is applied THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the corrective operation and restore the original logical state
5. IF multiple errors are injected THEN the system SHALL show when the code's correction capability is exceeded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning QEC implementation, I want to see the underlying quantum circuits, so that I can understand how to implement these codes in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests circuit view THEN the system SHALL display the current quantum circuit with proper gate visualization
2. WHEN any operation is performed THEN the system SHALL update the circuit diagram to reflect new gates
3. WHEN the user requests export THEN the system SHALL generate QASM code for the current circuit state
4. IF Classiq integration is available THEN the system SHALL use Classiq for automatic circuit generation and optimization
5. WHEN circuit complexity increases THEN the system SHALL maintain readable circuit diagrams with proper gate labeling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a beginner to quantum error correction, I want guided tutorials and explanations, so that I can learn QEC concepts progressively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first opens the application THEN the system SHALL provide a tutorial mode with step-by-step guidance
2. WHEN the user hovers over any UI element THEN the system SHALL display contextual tooltips explaining the element's purpose
3. WHEN the user completes an operation THEN the system SHALL provide educational feedback about what happened and why
4. IF the user makes an error or unexpected choice THEN the system SHALL provide helpful guidance without blocking progress
5. WHEN the user requests help THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive documentation about QEC concepts and the current code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want to experiment with different noise models and decoders, so that I can understand real-world QEC performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses advanced settings THEN the system SHALL provide options for different noise models including depolarizing and coherent errors
2. WHEN noise parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL update error probabilities and show their effects on correction success
3. WHEN multiple decoding strategies are available THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between classical lookup table and ML-based decoders
4. IF simulation becomes computationally intensive THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and allow cancellation
5. WHEN decoder performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL display success rates and failure modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want to create custom scenarios and exercises, so that I can design specific learning experiences for my students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses scenario creation THEN the system SHALL provide tools to set up custom error patterns and initial states
2. WHEN a scenario is saved THEN the system SHALL store the configuration and allow easy reloading
3. WHEN students work through scenarios THEN the system SHALL track their progress and provide feedback
4. IF preset examples are needed THEN the system SHALL include common scenarios like single-error correction and failure cases
5. WHEN sharing scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide export/import functionality for educational content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user on various devices, I want responsive and performant visualization, so that I can use the tool effectively regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL render within 3 seconds on standard hardware
2. WHEN complex visualizations are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth interactions without lag
3. WHEN the user resizes the browser window THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
4. IF the user's device has limited resources THEN the system SHALL provide simplified visualization modes
5. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent usage without performance degradation
